# Results

These results were generated over several iterations of the algorithm. Look
at the creation date to know which are most recent. 

## Plotting the convergence files

use the Python script [plot_convergence.py](../src/plot_convergence.py) to show the log log relation between $\Delta t$ and the strong and weak convergence errors. 

to see how this works, use

```bash
python3 plot_convergence.py --help
```
